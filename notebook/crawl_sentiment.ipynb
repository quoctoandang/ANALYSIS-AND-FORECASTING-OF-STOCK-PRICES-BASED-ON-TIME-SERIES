Inflationary pressure is undoubtedly building in the United States as vaccine rollouts bring economic normalisation but the jury is out on whether it will be a lasting change or merely transitory.\\n\\nFed speakers including the Richmond Fed's Thomas Barkin and the St Louis Fed's James Bullard offered up soothing words to the effect that no policy shifts were imminent. That has helped reverse some of this week's steep market losses, with U.S. and European shares set for stronger opens after a firm Wall Street close.\\n\\nBut signs of nervousness are palpable; market volatility gauges such as the VIX -- Wall Street's \\\"fear gauge\\\" are holding near March highs.\\n\\nThe dollar too, despite a small pullback overnight, is poised to close the week with healthy gains, especially against the yen. U.S. retail sales due later on Thursday may decide whether the dollar punches above the 110-yen level that will mark a two-month high.\\n\\nAlso global bond yields have eased - 10-year German borrowing costs have retreated from two-year highs for instance -- but inflationary concerns remain at the forefront with 10-year U.S. breakeven inflation rates comfortably perched near eight-year peaks.\\n\\nIt's also been a big week for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is holding just below $50,000. Smaller rival dogecoin meanwhile jumped as much as 20% after Tesla\\u2019s chief Elon Musk tweeted that he was involved in work to improve the token's transaction efficiency.\\n\\nWith the earnings seasons in cooling mode, the focus is shifting to the red-hot SPAC market with British technology investor Ian Osborne raising 400 million euros via a SPAC listing in Amsterdam\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFinally pandemic news is less than reassuring, with Singapore announcing the strictest curbs on social gathering since easing a COVID-19 lockdown last year while the number of infections in India climbed above 24 million in India.\\n\\nKey developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:\\n\\nU.S. Retail sales, industrial production\\n\\nECB April meeting minutes\\n\\nUniversity of Michigan consumer sentiment Index for May\",\n          \"For Immediate Release\\n\\nChicago, IL \\u2013 May 31, 2023 \\u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see all of today\\u2019s research reports here >>>\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla\\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+56.9% vs. +33.8%). The electric vehicle (EV) giant witnessed record deliveries for Models 3 and Y. The Zacks analyst expects deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 37% in 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth. We anticipate automotive revenues to rise 19% this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Tesla\\u2019s energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising. Falling debt levels is another positive. While inflation and economic concerns could pose near-term challenges, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and introduction of new models.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nShares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+6.8% vs. -6.8%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets compared with the other oil and gas majors acts as a tailwind.\\r\\n\\r\\nTTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TTE is making steady investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Yet, TTE\\u2019s production is impacted by the security-related production cuts in some regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTTE remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. A natural decline in production and TTE\\u2019s withdrawal from Russia might affect profitability.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nShares of Intuitive Surgical have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+34.8% vs. -2.0%). The da Vinci procedure volume continued its recovering trend of 2022 into the first quarter of 2023, which is likely to persist for the rest of the year. Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth in 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntuitive Surgical witnessed healthy customer demand for its products in the quarter under review. Its Ion platform has strong growth potential. A stable liquidity position is an added plus.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, higher component and labor costs, and a strong U.S. dollar continues to hurt gross margin. Stiff competition in the global MedTech space and rising costs remain concerns for Intuitive Surgical.\\r\\n\\r\\n(You can read the full research report on Intuitive Surgical here >>>)\\r\\n\\r\\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Charles Schwab and Monster Beverage Corp.\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\nsupport@zacks.com\\n\\nhttps://www.zacks.com\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

This is thanks in part to the introduction of more than a dozen new models.\\n\\nBut this growth comes as inventories have \\u201cdramatically increased\\u201d even as the average EV transaction price tumbled to $50,683 in September from over $65,000 one year ago.\\n\\n\\u201cProduct availability has grown exponentially, while consumer acceptance has grown in a more linear fashion,\\u201d it\\u00a0wrote.\\n\\nWhen examining EV demand, most analysts focus on their sequential growth from one quarter to the next to better gauge the rate of adoption, rather than the conventional year-on-year metric used for vehicles relying on mature technologies.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nViewed through this lens, growth has lately trailed off, with Q3 industry volumes estimated to have grown just 6% over the preceding three months.\\n\\nUncertainty hangs over Elon Musk\\u2019s Cybertruck reveal\\n\\nDuring the third quarter, F-150 Lightning sales actually dropped by a fifth compared with the previous quarter, according to Cox Automotive figures. If demand remains weaker than anticipated, it could be a cautionary tale as Farley looks to develop a new next-gen EV truck he dubbed in May a \\u201cpersonal bullet train.\\u201d\\n\\nThe slump in new orders of Ford\\u2019s EV truck is a sobering reversal of the company\\u2019s previous enthusiasm. In January 2022, it said it would\\u00a0nearly double line capacity at Rouge in order to build 150,000 Lightnings annually. That decision was made after 200,000 customers reserved their EV pickup in advance, enough at the time to book production out for nearly the next three years.\\n\\nTo keep its backlog manageable as more customers placed deposits, it even hiked prices from the base $40,000 sticker on the hood to $60,000, a\\u00a0hefty increase. Ford\\u2019s Farley subsequently liked to cite the Lightning as proof its EVs were just as desirable as Tesla\\u2019s and enjoyed similar pricing power.\\n\\nBut deposits are not the same as firm orders. It\\u2019s likely many customers had to cancel as their ability to afford the monthly financing payments dwindled amid\\u00a0soaring interest rates.\\n\\nOthers who had not yet gotten a prompt by Ford to confirm their interest with a fixed order for receiving delivery of their F-150 Lightning may now be on the fence as they wait at least to see if the hotly anticipated Cybertruck is a more attractive option.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s because Elon Musk has\\u00a0kept consumers in suspense until the final moment. Even after he teased in July what many believed to be the first Cybertruck built for customers, there has been no word of the official launch date, while final performance specs and prices remain a closely guarded secret.\\n\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 34662,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-accused-fuelling-anti-semitism-202304280.html\",\n          \"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-musk-tweets-proxy-voting-180719413.html\",\n          \"https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a1a06a31-8a4f-3e88-93d8-f11d089696c1/cathie-wood-likes-tesla.-but.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"symbols\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
